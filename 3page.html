<h2 align="center"> 1. What Is Robotics, Exactly? Definition</h2>
<p>Robotics is a multidisciplinary field that involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. It combines elements from engineering, computer science, artificial intelligence, and other disciplines to create machines that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.

    Robots can vary widely in form and function, from industrial robots used in manufacturing to service robots for healthcare, agriculture, or household tasks. The goal of robotics is often to improve efficiency, safety, and precision in various applications, while also enhancing human capabilities.</p>
<hr>
<h2 align="center"> 2. Types of Robots</h2>
<p>There are several types of robots, each designed for specific tasks and applications. Here are some of the main categories:<br>

    1. Industrial Robots: Used in manufacturing and assembly lines, these robots perform tasks like welding, painting, and material handling. They are often fixed in place and designed for high precision.<br>
    
    2. Service Robots: These robots assist humans in tasks, such as cleaning (e.g., vacuum robots), delivery (e.g., delivery drones), or providing information (e.g., kiosks).<br>
    
    3. Medical Robots: Utilized in healthcare, these robots assist in surgeries, rehabilitation, and patient care. Examples include robotic surgical systems and exoskeletons for mobility assistance.<br>
    
    4. Exploration Robots: Designed for exploration in harsh or inaccessible environments, such as space (e.g., Mars rovers) or underwater (e.g., underwater drones).<br>
    
    5. Humanoid Robots: These robots are designed to resemble and mimic human behavior. They can be used for research, companionship, or entertainment.<br>
    
    6. Agricultural Robots: Employed in farming to automate tasks like planting, harvesting, and monitoring crops, enhancing efficiency and productivity.<br>
    
    7.*Military and Security Robots: Used for surveillance, reconnaissance, and bomb disposal, these robots enhance safety and effectiveness in defense operations.<br>
    
    8. Collaborative Robots (Cobots): Designed to work alongside humans, these robots assist with tasks in various settings, sharing workspaces safely.<br>
    
    9. Autonomous Vehicles: Including self-driving cars and drones, these robots navigate and operate without human intervention.<br>
    
    Each type of robot is engineered with specific capabilities tailored to its intended applications.</p>
